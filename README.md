# ArduinoFoodInterpretter
Arduino and openAi / machine learning to see and give you information about a food item! 
The arduino will have three lights; red, yellow, green. Regarding whatever food item you show it will light up as to signify if the food is healthy (green) or not (red). You will receive feedback via voice or a short message regarding nutritional facts related to whatever food item is shown. The point of the project is to enable a quick way of knowing calories, protein, carbs, and fats about any food item.
